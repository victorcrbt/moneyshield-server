## RUNNING THE PROJECT

If you have docker and docker-compose installed, just run `docker-compose up` and all the development environment will be created for you.

Otherwise, you'll need to install the dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn` an then start the server with `npm run dev:server` or `yarn dev:server`.

## DESCRIPTION

I'm developing this application with two purposes:

- Test some tools, like Prisma.
- Organize my financings that are a mess right now hahaha

When I have the frontend repository, I will link in here. I intend to make a React Native APP as well, but with less features, more focused in view data.
